Sketch is a visual debugging library for Roblox, allowing you to render visual representations of rays, text and shapes with ease.
This project is still in it's infancy, and is just meant to be a quick utility library.

## Installation

### Wally
[Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) is a package manager for Roblox, allowing you to integrate this (and countless other unique and helpful libraries)
directly into your project through a controlled system. To use this library in wally, you can simply add the following to your `wally.toml`:

```toml
Sketch = "xactlyblue/sketch@1.0.0"
```

### Rojo
If you don't want to use a package manager like Wally, you can git-clone the source code directly into the folder you'd prefer and [Rojo](https://rojo.space) can take care of the rest.

``git clone "https://github.com/xactlyblue/sketch"``
